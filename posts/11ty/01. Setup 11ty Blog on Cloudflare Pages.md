To set up an Eleventy (11ty) blog and host it on Cloudflare Pages, follow these three simple phases.

### **Phase 1: Local Setup**

First, create your blog on your computer. Open your terminal and run these commands:

1. **Initialize your project:**  
   Bash  
   mkdir my-11ty-blog && cd my-11ty-blog  
   npm init \-y  
   npm install @11ty/eleventy \--save-dev

2. **Create your first post:**  
   Create a file named index.md in your folder and add some content:  
   Markdown  
   \---  
   title: My First Post  
   \---  
   \# Hello World\!  
   This is my 11ty blog hosted on Cloudflare.

3. **Add a Build Script:**  
   Open package.json and add this line inside the "scripts" section:  
   JSON  
   "scripts": {  
     "build": "npx @11ty/eleventy"  
   }

**Phase 2: Push to GitHub**

Now, move your code to the cloud so Cloudflare can "see" it.

1. **Create a .gitignore file:**  
   In your project root, create a file named .gitignore and add:  
   Plaintext  
   node\_modules/  
   \_site/

2. **Commit and Push:**  
   * Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository (keep it public or private, either works).  
   * Run these commands in your terminal (replace the URL with your actual repo URL):

Bash  
git init  
git add .  
git commit \-m "initial commit"  
git branch \-M main  
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git  
git push \-u origin main

### **Phase 3: Connect to Cloudflare Pages**

This is where the actual "hosting" happens.

1. **Log in to Cloudflare:** Go to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to **Workers & Pages**.  
2. **Create a Project:** Click **Create \> Pages \> Connect to Git**.  
3. **Select Repository:** Choose the GitHub repository you just pushed to.  
4. **Configure Build Settings:**  
   * **Framework preset:** Choose Eleventy.  
   * **Build command:** npm run build (or npx @11ty/eleventy).  
   * **Build output directory:** \_site.  
5. **Deploy:** Click **Save and Deploy**.

**How the Workflow Looks**

Once this is finished, your publishing process becomes incredibly simple:

* **To publish a new post:** Just add a .md file to your folder.  
* **To go live:** Run git add, git commit, and git push.  
* **Result:** Cloudflare detects the push, builds the site, and updates your blog automatically in about 30 seconds.
