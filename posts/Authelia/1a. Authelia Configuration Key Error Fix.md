Ah, it looks like I gave you the wrong key for the custom assets. In recent versions of Authelia (v4.38+), that specific configuration moved under the server block but with a slightly different structure.  
The error configuration key not expected: server.custom\_assets.path confirms that Authelia doesn't recognize where you put that line.

### **The Fix: Update the Asset Path**

In the newer versions, the configuration should look like this:

YAML

server:  
  address: 'tcp://0.0.0.0:9091/'  
  \# The correct key is 'asset\_path', not 'custom\_assets.path'  
  asset\_path: /config/assets/

### **Why it crashed**

Authelia is very strict about its YAML schema. If it encounters a key it doesn't recognize (like custom\_assets), it assumes the configuration is malformed and shuts down immediately to prevent security risks.

**Cleaned up configuration.yml**

Since your logs also showed several "deprecated" warnings, here is the modernized version of those blocks to stop the warnings and fix the crash:

YAML

server:  
  address: 'tcp://0.0.0.0:9091/'  
  asset\_path: /config/assets/

session:  
  name: authelia\_session  
  secret: 'YOUR\_SESSION\_SECRET'  
  cookies:  
    \- domain: 'britbuzz.uk'  
      authelia\_url: 'https://auth.britbuzz.uk'  
      default\_redirection\_url: 'https://vscode.britbuzz.uk'

\# Keep your Duo and Access Control sections as they were

**Verifying the Assets**

Once you change the key to asset\_path and restart the container, Authelia will look in /config/assets/ for:

1. logo.png (to replace the top-left logo)  
2. favicon.ico (to replace the browser tab icon)

**Try making that change in your configuration.yml and run docker compose up \-d. Does the container stay "Up" now?**
