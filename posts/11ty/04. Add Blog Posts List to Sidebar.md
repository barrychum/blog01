To put a list of posts on the right side, we need to do two things: update your **layout** to include a sidebar and use 11ty's **Collections** feature to fetch your posts automatically.

### **1. Update your Layout (The HTML/CSS)**

We will use CSS Flexbox to create a two-column layout. Replace the content of your _includes/layout.njk with this:

HTML

```
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en">  
<head>  
  <meta charset="UTF-8">  
  <title>{{ title }}</title>  
  <style>  
    body { font-family: sans-serif; max-width: 1000px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px; line-height: 1.6; }  
    nav { margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee; padding-bottom: 10px; }  
      
    /* The Flexbox Container */  
    .container { display: flex; gap: 40px; }  
    main { flex: 3; }      /* Content takes up 3 parts */  
    aside { flex: 1; border-left: 1px solid #eee; padding-left: 20px; } /* Sidebar takes 1 part */  
      
    .post-list { list-style: none; padding: 0; }  
    .post-list li { margin-bottom: 10px; }  
  </style>  
</head>  
<body>  
  <nav><a href="/">Home</a> | <a href="/about/">About</a></nav>

  <div class="container">  
    <main>  
      <h1>{{ title }}</h1>  
      {{ content | safe }}  
    </main>

    <aside>  
      <h3>All Posts</h3>  
      <ul class="post-list">  
        {% for post in collections.post %}  
          <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a></li>  
        {% endfor %}  
      </ul>  
    </aside>  
  </div>  
</body>  
</html>
```

**2. How 11ty knows what a "Post" is**

By default, 11ty doesn't know which files are "posts" and which are "pages" (like About). The easiest way to tell 11ty is by using **tags**.  
Update your blog post files (e.g., 2026-02-03-first-post.md) to include the post tag:

Markdown

---  
layout: layout.njk  
title: My First Blog Post  
tags: post  
---  
Your content here...

*Note: Your index.md and about.md should **not** have the post tag, otherwise they will appear in the sidebar list.*

### ---

**3. Creating a "Posts" Folder (Best Practice)**

Instead of adding tags: post to every single file manually, you can create a folder called posts/ and add a "Directory Data File" to tag everything inside it automatically.

1. **Move your posts:** Put your blog posts in a folder named posts.  
2. **Create a JSON file:** Inside that same posts/ folder, create a file named posts.json.  
3. **Add this code:**  

```
   JSON  
   {  
     "tags": "post"  
   }

   *Now, any Markdown file you drop into the posts/ folder is automatically added to the sidebar list!*
```



**How it Works (Visualizing the Build)**

* **Collections:** 11ty scans your files for the tag post and creates an array called collections.post.  
* **The Loop:** The {% for post in collections.post %} code in your layout loops through that array and generates a link for each one.  
* **The CSS:** Flexbox ensures the list stays on the right while your main content stays on the left.

**Would you like me to show you how to add a "date" to those posts so they appear in order?**
