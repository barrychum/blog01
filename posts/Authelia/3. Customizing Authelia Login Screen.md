To customize the Authelia login screen, you need to understand that Authelia's design philosophy is "security first." Consequently, it doesn't have a theme editor in the UI. Instead, customization is handled through the **configuration.yml** file or by custom building the frontend.  
For your B2-C1 English level, here is a concise guide on how to implement these changes.

## ---

**1\. The Easy Way: Built-in Theming**

As of recent versions, Authelia supports basic theme selection (Light, Dark, or Grey) and custom branding via the configuration file.

Add the following to your configuration.yml:

YAML

theme: 'dark' \# Options: light, dark, grey, auto

server:  
  \# This adds your logo and a custom message to the login page  
  custom\_assets:  
    path: /config/assets/

### **Adding Your Logo**

1. Create a folder: /mnt/disk2/docker/authelia/config/assets/.  
2. Place a file named logo.png (transparent background recommended) in that folder.

3. Authelia will automatically detect this and replace the default logo on the login screen.

**2\. Customizing the Brand Name**

If you want to change the text that appears in the browser tab and on the login header, use the telemetry and server blocks:

YAML

server:  
  headers:  
    csp:  
      \# Optional: Hardening headers if you use external assets  
      script-src: "'self'"

\# This changes the "powered by Authelia" or page titles in some versions  
telemetry:  
  metrics:  
    enabled: false

**3\. Advanced Customization: Custom CSS**

Authelia does not natively support an "extra-css.css" file in the standard configuration yet. If you want to change colors (e.g., making the buttons blue instead of the default orange), you have two choices:

### **Option A: Use a Reverse Proxy (Traefik) Injector**

You can use a Traefik plugin or a middleware (like a "Replace Path" or a specialized header injector) to inject a custom CSS stylesheet into the Authelia page. This is quite advanced and can be brittle.

### **Option B: Build from Source**

If you are comfortable with Docker builds, you can clone the Authelia repository, modify the React files in the web directory, and build your own custom Docker image.

**4\. Customizing Redirection and Links**

You can customize where users go after they log in or what links they see for password resets.

YAML

identity\_validation:  
  reset\_password:  
    \# This must point to your auth domain  
    html\_template: /config/email\_template.html 

### ---

**Summary of what you can change easily:**

| Element | Method |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Logo** | Drop logo.png into the custom\_assets folder. |
| **Theme** | Set theme to dark, light, or grey. |
| **Favicon** | Drop favicon.ico into the custom\_assets folder. |
| **App Name** | Controlled via various metadata fields in config. |

**Since you've fixed the 500 error and the container is running, would you like me to show you the specific folder structure needed to get your logo appearing on that login screen?**
