Adding a "Read Time" estimator is a great touch. It gives readers a quick heads-up on how much time they need to commit to your article.  
To do this, we'll create a small **JavaScript Filter** in your 11ty configuration that calculates the time based on an average reading speed (usually 200 words per minute).

### **1. Add the Filter to .eleventy.js**

Open your .eleventy.js file and add this logic inside the module.exports function:

JavaScript

module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {  
    
  // Read Time Filter  
  eleventyConfig.addFilter("readTime", (content) => {  
    const wordsPerMinute = 200;  
    // Strip HTML tags to get a clean word count  
    const text = content.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, "");  
    const wordCount = text.split(/s+/).length;  
    const readingTime = Math.ceil(wordCount / wordsPerMinute);  
    return `${readingTime} min read`;  
  });

  // ... (keep your existing date filters and return statement)  
};

### ---

**2. Update your Layout to Show the Read Time**

Now, you can display this on your blog posts. Open _includes/layout.njk and place the filter near your title or date.

HTML

<main>  
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>  
  <p style="color: #666;">  
    {# Show date and read time only if it's a post #}  
    {% if tags and "post" in tags %}  
      {{ page.date | postDate }} • <span>{{ content | readTime }}</span>  
    {% endif %}  
  </p>  
    
  {{ content | safe }}  
  ...  
</main>

**3. (Optional) Show it in the Sidebar too!**

If you want readers to see the read time *before* they click a post, you can update your sidebar loop in the same layout file:

HTML

<aside>  
  <h3>Recent Posts</h3>  
  <ul class="post-list">  
    {% for post in collections.post | reverse %}  
      <li>  
        <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a><br>  
        <small>{{ post.date | postDate }} — {{ post.templateContent | readTime }}</small>  
      </li>  
    {% endfor %}  
  </ul>  
</aside>

*Note: In the loop, we use post.templateContent instead of just content.*

### **Why this works**

1. **Word Count:** 11ty takes the raw content of your Markdown file.  
2. **The Math:** It divides the total words by 200.  
3. **Rounding:** Math.ceil ensures that even a short 50-word post shows as "1 min read" rather than "0 min read."

### **4. Push to Live**

Save, commit, and push!

Bash

git add .  
git commit -m "Add read time estimation"  
git push origin main

**Your blog is looking very professional now. Would you like to add a "Table of Contents" to your posts, or perhaps a way to show "Related Posts" at the bottom?**
