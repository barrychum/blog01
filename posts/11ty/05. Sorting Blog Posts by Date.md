To get your posts appearing in the correct order (usually newest at the top), we’ll use 11ty’s built-in date handling and a small tweak to your sidebar loop.

### **1. Ensure your posts have dates**

Eleventy is smart about dates. It can get the date for a post in three ways:

1. **From the filename:** If you name your file 2026-02-03-my-post.md, 11ty automatically assigns that date.  
2. **From the Front Matter:** You can manually set it like this:  
   YAML  
   ---  
   title: My Post  
   date: 2026-02-03  
   ---

3. **From the file creation date:** If you do neither, 11ty uses the date the file was created on your computer (this is less reliable).

**2. Update the Sidebar (Sorting & Formatting)**

Go back to your _includes/layout.njk file. We will modify the loop to **reverse** the order (newest first) and display the date next to the link.  
Replace your <aside> section with this:

HTML

<aside>  
  <h3>Recent Posts</h3>  
  <ul class="post-list">  
    {# We add | reverse to show newest first #}  
    {% for post in collections.post | reverse %}  
      <li>  
        <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a><br>  
        <small>{{ post.date.toDateString() }}</small>  
      </li>  
    {% endfor %}  
  </ul>  
</aside>

### ---

**3. Making Dates Look Better (Optional but Recommended)**

The .toDateString() method outputs dates like Mon Feb 03 2026. If you want more control (like Feb 03, 2026), you can add a "filter" to your configuration.

1. **Open (or create) .eleventy.js** in your project root.  
2. **Add this filter:**  
   JavaScript  
   const { DateTime } = require("luxon"); // 11ty usually comes with luxon

   module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {  
     // Date formatting filter  
     eleventyConfig.addFilter("postDate", (dateObj) => {  
       return DateTime.fromJSDate(dateObj).toLocaleString(DateTime.DATE_MED);  
     });

     return {  
       dir: {  
         input: ".",  
         output: "_site"  
       }  
     };  
   };

3. **Update your layout** to use the new filter:  
   {{ post.date | postDate }}

**The Final Result**

Your blog now has a logical flow. When you add a new file to your posts/ folder, 11ty detects the date, sorts it to the top of the sidebar, and Cloudflare deploys the update automatically.
