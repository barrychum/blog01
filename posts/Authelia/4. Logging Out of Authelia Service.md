To logout from Authelia, you have two primary methods: the **Manual Portal** method and the **Automated Redirection** method for your applications.

### **1\. The Manual Method**

The most direct way to terminate your session is to visit your Authelia portal URL directly:

* **URL:** https://auth.britbuzz.uk

Once there, you will see a **Logout** button. Clicking this clears the session cookie from your browser and tells the Authelia server to invalidate your session ID.

**2\. The Application "Logout" Link (Recommended)**

If you want to add a "Logout" button to the navigation bar of your other services (like your VSCode or other proxied apps), you should link that button to the Authelia logout endpoint.

* **Logout Endpoint:** https://auth.britbuzz.uk/logout

You can also specify where the user should be sent *after* they are logged out by adding a redirection parameter:

* **Redirect URL:** https://auth.britbuzz.uk/logout?rd=https://google.com

**3\. Automatic Session Expiry**

You can also control how long a user stays logged in before they are automatically kicked out. This is handled in your configuration.yml under the session block:

YAML

session:  
  \# ... other settings ...  
  expiration: 3600 \# Total time in seconds (e.g., 1 hour)  
  inactivity: 900  \# Logout after 15 minutes of no activity

**4\. Important Note on "Single Sign-Out"**

It is important to understand how the logout process works with Traefik:

* When you log out of Authelia, the **Authelia session cookie** is cleared.  
* The next time you try to access vscode.britbuzz.uk, Traefik's forwardAuth middleware will ask Authelia if you are logged in.  
* Authelia will see the cookie is gone and redirect you back to the login screen.

**Note:** If the application you are using (like VSCode or Nextcloud) has its *own* internal login system in addition to Authelia, logging out of Authelia will **not** necessarily log you out of the application's internal session until you refresh the page or that app's cookie expires.
