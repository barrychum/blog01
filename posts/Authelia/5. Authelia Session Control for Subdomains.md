To implement different session lengths for different subdomains (e.g., a "short" session for a sensitive financial app and a "long" session for a media server), you use the **Access Control** rules in your configuration.yml.  
While the global session is defined in the session block, you can override the **security requirements** per domain.

### **1\. Configure Different Session Durations**

In Authelia, the session block defines the maximum age of the cookie, but you can use inactivity to force logs-outs on specific services by setting a strict global default and then relaxing it for others.  
However, the most common way to handle "sensitive" apps is to force **2FA** on them while allowing **1FA** on others.

### **2\. Implementation in configuration.yml**

Here is how you structure the access\_control section to treat subdomains differently:

YAML

access\_control:  
  default\_policy: 'deny' \# Secure by default  
  rules:  
    \# 1\. The "Sensitive" App: Requires 2FA (e.g., Duo or Passkey)  
    \- domain: 'vault.britbuzz.uk'  
      policy: 'two\_factor'

    \# 2\. The "Standard" App: Requires 1FA (Username/Password)  
    \- domain: 'vscode.britbuzz.uk'  
      policy: 'one\_factor'

    \# 3\. The "Public" App: No login required (but still passes through Authelia for headers)  
    \- domain: 'public.britbuzz.uk'  
      policy: 'bypass'

**3\. Handling "Remember Me"**

If you want users to stay logged in for days on certain devices but not others, ensure you have the remember\_me option enabled in your session config:

YAML

session:  
  \# ... other settings ...  
  remember\_me: 30d \# Users can check a box to stay logged in for 30 days

### ---

**4\. Advanced: Multiple Session Providers (Rare)**

If you truly need a 15-minute timeout for finance.britbuzz.uk and a 7-day timeout for plex.britbuzz.uk, Authelia currently does not support two different session timers in a single instance.  
**The workaround:**  
You would run **two separate Authelia containers**:

1. authelia-short: Configured with a 15m session.  
2. authelia-long: Configured with a 1d session.

Then, in Traefik, you would point the specific routers to the different middleware:

* finance-router \-\> auth-short@file  
* media-router \-\> auth-long@file

### **Next Step**

Since we've discussed **2FA** requirements for specific domains, would you like me to show you the **Duo API** configuration block so you can start testing that "two\_factor" policy on your sensitive apps?
