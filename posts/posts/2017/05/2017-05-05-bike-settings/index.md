gear inches = (chainring / cog) \* wheel diameter in inches

gear capacity = chainring gear difference + cog gear difference

Shimano rear derailuer length depends on gear capacity

A Japanese group found that the cadence with the lowest oxygen cost (VO2) was not the same as that producing the lowest muscular fatigue.

Measuring the electrical activity of cycling specific muscles, called an electromyogram (EMG), they found 80-90 rpm had significantly lower EMG activity than any other cadence (70rpm, 100rpm). The lowest amount of oxygen was used when pedalling at 60-70rpm.
