Adding "Next" and "Previous" links (often called **Pagination**) makes your blog much more user-friendly. It allows readers to continue reading without having to go back to the homepage or the sidebar.

### **1. Update the Post Folder Settings**

To let 11ty know that posts should be treated as a sequence, we need to add a bit of configuration to your posts/posts.json file.  
Open posts/posts.json and update it to look like this:

JSON

{  
  "tags": "post",  
  "layout": "layout.njk"  
}

*(Note: Moving the layout here means you no longer have to type layout: layout.njk in every single blog post file!)*

### ---

**2. Add the Navigation to your Layout**

Open _includes/layout.njk. We will add the navigation links right after the {{ content | safe }} line inside the <main> tag.

HTML

<main>  
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>  
  {{ content | safe }}

  <hr>

  {# Pagination Logic #}  
  {% if tags and "post" in tags %}  
    <nav class="post-nav">  
      {% set previousPost = collections.post | getPreviousCollectionItem(page) %}  
      {% set nextPost = collections.post | getNextCollectionItem(page) %}

      <div>  
        {% if previousPost %}  
          <strong>Previous:</strong><br>  
          <a href="{{ previousPost.url }}">{{ previousPost.data.title }}</a>  
        {% endif %}  
      </div>

      <div style="text-align: right;">  
        {% if nextPost %}  
          <strong>Next:</strong><br>  
          <a href="{{ nextPost.url }}">{{ nextPost.data.title }}</a>  
        {% endif %}  
      </div>  
    </nav>  
  {% endif %}  
</main>

### ---

**3. Add the Styling**

To make the links look nice and sit on opposite sides of the page, add this to your <style> block in the layout file:

CSS

.post-nav {  
  display: flex;  
  justify-content: space-between;  
  margin-top: 40px;  
  padding-top: 20px;  
}  
.post-nav div {  
  flex: 1;  
}

**How it looks in practice**

11ty automatically calculates which post comes before and after the current one based on the **date**.

### **4. Push to Cloudflare**

Commit your changes to send them live:

Bash

git add .  
git commit -m "Add post-to-post navigation"  
git push origin main

**Great job! Your blog now has a layout, a sidebar, responsive design, and post-to-post navigation. Would you like to add a "Read Time" estimator (e.g., "5 min read") to your posts next?**
