Publishing a blog post with Eleventy (11ty) follows a standard Jamstack workflow. Since 11ty is a static site generator, the process is less about clicking "Publish" in a dashboard and more about managing files and version control.  
Here are the most common steps for publishing a blog post:

### **1\. Create a New Content File**

Most 11ty blogs use **Markdown** for content. You typically create a new file in your posts directory (e.g., src/posts/).

* **Filename:** Usually formatted as YYYY-MM-DD-title.md or just title.md.  
* **Front Matter:** At the top of the file, you define metadata in YAML format between triple dashes.  
  YAML  
  \---  
  title: "My New Blog Post"  
  date: 2026-02-03  
  tags: \["eleventy", "webdev"\]  
  layout: layouts/post.njk  
  \---  
  Your blog content goes here...

### **2\. Local Preview and Testing**

Before going live, you run 11ty’s built-in development server to check your formatting and layout.

* **Command:** npx @11ty/eleventy \--serve (or npm start if you have it scripted in package.json).  
* **Action:** Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser. Eleventy features "hot reloading," so any changes you save to your Markdown file will appear instantly.

### **3\. Build for Production (Optional if Automated)**

You can manually generate the final HTML files to see exactly what will be uploaded.

* **Command:** npx @11ty/eleventy  
* **Result:** This populates your output folder (usually \_site/ or public/) with static HTML, CSS, and images.

### **4\. Push to Version Control**

The "publishing" trigger for most 11ty users is a simple Git command.

* **Action:** Commit your new post and push it to a repository like GitHub or GitLab.  
  Bash  
  git add .  
  git commit \-m "Add new post: My New Blog Post"  
  git push origin main

### **5\. Automated Deployment**

Most developers connect their GitHub repository to a hosting provider like **Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages**.

* **Continuous Deployment:** Once you push your code, the host detects the change, automatically runs the build command (npx @11ty/eleventy), and serves the updated static files to the web.  
* **Wait Time:** Your post is usually live within 30–60 seconds of your Git push.

**Pro-Tip: Handling Drafts**

If you aren't ready to publish, many 11ty setups use a draft: true flag in the front matter. You can configure your .eleventy.js file to exclude any files with this flag during the production build, while still showing them during local development.
