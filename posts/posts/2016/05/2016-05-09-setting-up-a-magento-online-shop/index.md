Have been comparing woocommerce, prestashop and magento CE. Magento is the most versatile and flexible. All 3 platforms require some customization to fit the requirements, but magento seems to be the most flexible one. Once you get used to the Mage model, customization will not be that difficult and you can write your own programs or interfaces in PHP.
